== Description ==
This plugin allows you to display widgets based on if a user is logged in, logged out, an Admin User or to All Users.

This solves the problem of having to modify theme functions.php files to add in widget restrictions based on users status.  The changes in functions.php is often overwritten by a theme update.  This plugin removes that worry, as you can update the theme, independent of the plugin.
